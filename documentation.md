- ### Operation and Security Policy
###### I, a Discord user, under the username and tag `ost#4823` - created this application and is the head of applications from Tentel and the Tentel Crew.

   ###### This page is used to inform visitors about my rules for collecting, using and disclosing Personal Information if someone decides to use my Service.

   ###### If you decide to use my Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in connection with this policy. The personal information I collect is used to provide and improve the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

   ###### My bot is not meant to be scammed.  I'm not going to create commands that will help me hack someone else's Discord server!

   ###### My product can save information about the names of the Servers on which the bot is present.

   ###### Some additional services may cost real money. But these services are not required!

   ###### The bot bans inappropriate users or users with defiant behavior. The main developer, whether he is on the server, has the right to ban, through a special command, a user who violates adequate behavior in the server community.

- ### Functions
#### The main function of the bot is protection against vulnerabilities, that is, Crash (Nuke).
#### There are a lot of Crash (Nuke) bots at the present time, and good protection either costs money, or it doesn’t exist at all.

##### *Bot Tentel helps to cope with DDoS-attacks from Crash (Nuke) Bots. Tentel eliminates all bots that are not on its whitelist.*

---

- ### Safety
#### It is necessary to move the role 'Tentel Operative' to the very top of the list of roles.

#### All other bots must be on the bottom (for general safety).
#### To enable Crash (Nuke) Bots removal security mode, enter the command `t_protect`.

---

- ### Link Security
#### Security is about eliminating dangerous links. You can enable protection with the command `t_block-link on`.
