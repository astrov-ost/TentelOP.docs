### Introduction
###### Bot Tentel helps to cope with DDoS-attacks from Crash Bots. Tentel has a "signature segmentation" to eliminate Crash Bots. This means that our bot immediately destroys the source of the problems, the crash bot itself. The bot works as soon as it enters the server!

### Actions
##### To secure the server, you will need:
- ###### Enter the command `t_protect` or `/protect` through the command splash. Safety from Crash Bots is provided.
- ###### Further, continuing, enter the command `t_PROban`. It will ban inappropriate Discord users who are Quarantined under the terms of the Documentation *(that inappropriate Discord users will be banned from the servers)*. The function will require re-introduction when the "Quarantine" database is updated *(enter the command yourself after a certain period of time)*.
- ###### After all this, and finally, to create the most favorable Discord Server environment, you can enter the command `t_block-link on`. It blocks almost all links, as well as viral ones.

##### And of course, put the Bot role at the very top so that no one can touch it, except for the Server Owner!
