### Actions
##### To secure the server, you will need:
- ###### Enter the command `t_protect` or `/protect` through the command splash. Safety from Crash (Nuke) Bots is provided.
- ###### Further, continuing, enter the command `t_PROban`. It will ban inappropriate Discord users who are Quarantined under the terms of the Documentation *(that inappropriate Discord users will be banned from the servers)*. The function will require re-introduction when the "Quarantine" database is updated *(enter the command yourself after a certain period of time)*.
- ###### After all this, and finally, to create the most favorable Discord Server environment, you can enter the command `t_block-link on`. It blocks almost all links, as well as viral ones.

##### And of course, put the Bot role at the very top so that no one can touch it, except for the Server Owner!
